IBM Cloud Private v2.1 Network, DNS, PKI Certificates, LDAP
============================================================
This document focuses on the following infrastructure requirements for ICP:
- Networking
- DNS entries
- PKI certificates
- LDAP configuration

Some of this information is needed to complete the configuration file (config.yml) for the ICP installation.

# ICP networking

TBD - Recommended subnets, management? backups? application?

## Sub-domain naming

TBD - Typical sub-domain names to be created?

## DNS entries

TBD - wild card DNS entries

# PKI certificates

TBD - What PKI certificates are needed for ICP itself.  What certs are needed for applications.  Wildcard certs are likely needed for applications as each (micro-service) application may get its own virtual host name.

# LDAP configuration  

TBD - Specifics on LDAP configuration. (Not how to do it, but rather what is needed.)
